    <description>Davion the Dragon Knight is a very tough melee strength hero with a relatively versatile skill set. Dragon Knight has a nuke and a stun, giving him an advantage in ganks. Dragon Knight has no real escape ability, though his Dragon Blood ability and armor make him capable of withstanding strong hits and recovering quickly. He is still very vulnerable in the early game, however, and needs to farm and stay alive in order to be effective in later stages. If he has enough levels and farm, Dragon Knight is very formidable late game due to his strong ultimate, transforming into a legendary dragon, turning him into one of the most dangerous beasts in late game, capable of eliminating multiple enemies at once.</description>

    <tips>
        <tip>Dragon Knight is one of the few heroes with no cast-time on his abilities, so spellcasts can be squeezed in between attacks on the backswing animation.</tip>
        <tip>Dragon Tail is a powerful ability to have and should be taken before other abilities, but it levels poorly. Some players even choose to take Attribute Bonus over further levels in it.</tip>
        <tip>Many guides recommend not levelling Elder Dragon Form at lvl 11, but those guides are outdated. Prior to version 6.78, the Red Dragon did not carry over the corrosive effect from the Green Dragon, which made it inferior at pushing down towers. Due to the recent patch, it is no longer necessary to skip levelling the ultimate at lvl 11.</tip>
        <tip>Soul Ring is a useful item on Dragon Knight, as it allows him to farm using Breathe Fire constantly, and the extra regeneration from Soul Ring and Dragon Blood offsets the health loss.</tip>
