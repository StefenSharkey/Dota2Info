    <description>Kaolin the Earth Spirit is a highly adaptable strength hero with great utility, able to effectively fill the role of a support, ganker, or offlaner, while still having a large game presence due to his strong initiation. Unlike most heroes, his abilities revolve around an innate ability, Stone Remnant. Because of Stone Remnant's synergy with his other abilities, Earth Spirit has an incredibly high skill ceiling, and can be challenging to master. He can be surprisingly mobile, owing to his Rolling Boulder, and can use this in combination with his other abilities to position himself to disable multiple enemies, save allies from certain death and generally become a commanding presence in a teamfight, even without a great deal of farm. With good timing he can initiate fights from a distance, and given the right circumstances can deal a surprising amount of damage to both single and multiple targets, all the while disrupting enemy positioning allowing for easy kills. A useful ally and a dangerous enemy, the Earth Spirit's versatility and flexibility make him an ideal hero in almost any lineup or lane.</description>

        <notes>
            <note>Stun is applied to all enemy units within the radius of a smashed Stone Remnant. A smashed unit is not stunned and does not stun.</note>
            <note>Damage is applied to the targeted unit (if it's an enemy) instantly and to enemy units within the radius of the smashed unit or Stone Remnant.</note>
            <note>The cast range is 1300 units. In order to be able to smash something, one must first get within 200 range of the unit or remnant and then cast it.</note>
            <note>Targeting the ground will knock a Stone Remnant within 200 range of Earth Spirit towards the targeted direction. If no remnant is in range, nothing will happen.</note>
            <note>Units can only be knocked back by directly targeting them.</note>
            <note>Targeted units are not disabled during the knockback. They are able to attack, cast spells and items and can turn.</note>
            <note>Knockback does not cancel Channeling spells. Teleporting during the knockback cancels the knockback.</note>
            <note>Can be casted on siege units and the Spirit Bear, but not on ancient units (including Roshan) Warlock's Golem, Familliars and Storm, Earth and Fire from Primal Split.</note>
            <note>Unlike Geomagnetic Grip, Boulder Smash is able to knock enemy units out of Chronosphere and Black Hole. It also works on units currently in a Duel.</note>
            <note>Casting Boulder Smash on a unit under the effect of Flaming Lasso damages enemies within the radius around the target upon cast, but does not knock it back.</note>
            <note>Can move units and Stone Remnants over impassable terrain.</note>
            <note>Units and Stone Remnants destroy trees they collide with.</note>
            <note>The cooldown for Boulder Smash will not reset unless a unit is struck.</note>

        <notes>
            <note>Will always roll for the full distance when not colliding with an enemy hero.</note>
            <note>When colliding with an enemy hero, Earth Spirit lands at the opposite side of the hero from where he collided with and the rolling stops.</note>
            <note>Rolling over a Stone Remnants increases the roll distance by 800 units, damage by 45, rolling speed by 800ms and adds the slow.</note>
            <note>Slow is applied to all units in the path, not just the hero it collides with.</note>
            <note>Rolling Boulder entangles Earth Spirit for its full duration. Means he cannot blink or attack during it, but can cast other items and spells and can turn.</note>
            <note>When Earth Spirit gets stunned, slept, cycloned or force moved by another spell at any time during Rolling Boulder, it instantly ends.</note>
            <note>Hex only cancels Rolling Boulder while rolling, not during the 0.6 seconds delay.</note>
            <note>Ensnares, entangles and taunts do not cancel Rolling Boulder (Frostbite cancels it, because it applies a mini-stun).</note>
            <note>Does not affect invulnerable units and heroes. Can't collide with invulnerable heroes.</note>
            <note>Fully affects invisible units and heroes.</note>

            <note>Targeting the spell on the ground will pull a Stone Remnant within 180 units of the target point in that direction. Units can only be pulled by directly targeting them.</note>
            <note>Stone Remnants move at 1000 speed when pulled, while allies move at 600 speed.</note>

        <note>Kaolin begins the game with and cannot have more than six Stone Charges.</note>
        <note>Charges represent the number shown on the status buff icon. It does not mean he can have only 6 remnants on the field.</note>
        <note>It's possible to have up to 9 remnants on the field when placing all 6 remants at once, and then every time after the 30 seconds recharge.</note>

        <note>Stone Remnants are invulnerable and have zero collision (they can be stacked).</note>
        <note>Stone Remnants can only disappear by running out of time, 5 seconds after being used by Magnetize, or instantly by Rolling Boulder.</note>
        <note>Does not interact with spells which react on spell cast (eg Magic Stick, Curse of the Silent, Essence Aura etc.)</note>
