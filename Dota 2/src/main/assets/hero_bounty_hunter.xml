    <description>Gondar the Bounty Hunter is a melee agility Hero that excels in dealing high amounts of damage to single targets. Bounty Hunter can easily gank other lanes, using his Shadow Walk to sneak up on enemies and get easy kills. Shadow Walk also allows him to escape from dangerous situations, making him very elusive. Bounty Hunter can be played as a carry, though it is not recommended. Bounty Hunter is also extremely deadly as an offlaner, thanks to Track, which will grant True Sight, movement speed, and bonus gold, and Jinada, which amplifies the damage of his next attack every few seconds.</description>

    <tips>
        <tip>Track provides a great deal of benefits to the team, the vision and movement speed help with ganking enemies as well as with avoiding enemy ganks, and the bonus gold will provide a big advantage over the enemy team if you get kills. You should try to cast it on every enemy hero, though priority targets should be carries as well as those that can go invisible.</tip>
        <tip>Despite being classified a carry, Bounty Hunter is also a strong ganker. Your abilities give you a great deal of power in the mid game, you should use this time to gank enemies as the bonus gold from Track more than makes up for the farm you may miss.</tip>
        <tip>It is possible to get the bonus damage of Shadow Walk twice by attacking once during the fade time and once to break the invisibility. This can help securing last hits or harassing.</tip>
        <tip>Getting an Orb of Venom is an extremely effective item when ganking in the early phase of the game as the 12% slow together with the slow from Jinada can make your opponent much easier to kill.</tip>
