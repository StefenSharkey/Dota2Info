    <description>Karroch the Beastmaster is a melee strength hero whose versatility allows him to take on multiple roles. His hawks provide free flying vision and his boars can harass, slow, and stack jungle camps. His ultimate, Primal Roar, is the longest lasting single reliable stun in the game. He is an effective support with good disabling ability in team fights. His strengths lie primarily in the slow debuff his Boar inflicts and ability to easily provide vision at crucial locations on the map. His ultimate, the stunning Primal Roar and Wild Axes allow him to deal massive damage at a distance. Though he is able to easily take down undefended targets in the early game, most of his abilities do not directly combo with each other, although the debiliating effects he brings to a fight can greatly assist allies (along with his passive attack speed boost aura).</description>

        <notes>
            <note>Only enemy units are shoved aside from the path of the roar.</note>
            <note>Primal Roar can be used on Couriers to stun it, but it won't be damaged. Couriers are also not a valid target for the pushback.</note>
            <note>Knockback speed is 500ms and distance is 300 units, so the knockback duration is 0.6 seconds.</note>
            <note>The pushback and slow have a dynamic range, based on the distance between you and the primary target. The further away the target, the further the pushback and slow will reach beyond the target, and even a bit behind Beastmaster.</note>

    <tips>
        <tip>His Wild Axes skill is a powerful farming tool.</tip>
        <tip>Beastmaster can stack/farm ancients incredibly effectively with Wild Axes since it can affect magic immune units. This can be very effectively used in Dire offlane (bottom), as he doesn't need to leave the lane to do so.</tip>
        <tip>Although his abilities have a long range, Blink Dagger is still useful for lining up Primal Roar.</tip>
        <tip>Beastmaster works well alongside carries who already have attack power but lack attack speed (Like Sven Sven and Tiny Tiny) due to his attack speed boosting aura.</tip>
        <tip>If you buy Assault Cuirass, it will allow your main carry to focus on raw damage items, as he will already have 65 bonus attack speed from Beastmaster. It will also increase your whole team's survivability and physical damage output.</tip>
